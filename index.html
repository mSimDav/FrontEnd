              <h1>Don Quixote <span>by Miguel De Cervantes</span></h1>
              <p>
                Alonso Quixano, a retired country gentleman in his fifties,
                lives in an unnamed section of La Mancha with his niece and a
                housekeeper. He has become obsessed with books of chivalry, and
                believes their every word to be true, despite the fact that many
                of the events in them are clearly impossible. Quixano eventually
                appears to other people to have lost his mind from little sleep
                and food and because of so much reading.

              <h1>The Great Gatsby <span>by F. Scott Fitzgerald</span></h1>
              <p>
                The novel chronicles an era that Fitzgerald himself dubbed the
                "Jazz Age". Following the shock and chaos of World War I,
                American society enjoyed unprecedented levels of prosperity
                during the "roaring" 1920s as the economy soared. At the same
                time, Prohibition, the ban on the sale and manufacture of
                alcohol as mandated by the Eighteenth Amendment, made
                millionaires out of bootleggers and led to an increase in
                organized crime, for example the Jewish mafia. Although
                Fitzgerald, like Nick Carraway in his novel, idolized the riches
                and glamor of the age, he was uncomfortable with the
                unrestrained materialism and the lack of morality that went with
                it, a kind of decadence.

              <h1>Moby Dick <span>by Herman Melville</span></h1>
              <p>
                First published in 1851, Melville's masterpiece is, in Elizabeth
                Hardwick's words, "the greatest novel in American literature."
                The saga of Captain Ahab and his monomaniacal pursuit of the
                white whale remains a peerless adventure story but one full of
                mythic grandeur, poetic majesty, and symbolic power. Filtered
                through the consciousness of the novel's narrator, Ishmael,
                Moby-Dick draws us into a universe full of fascinating
                characters and stories, from the noble cannibal Queequeg to the
                natural history of whales, while reaching existential depths
                that excite debate and contemplation to this day.

                Epic in scale, War and Peace delineates in graphic detail events
                leading up to Napoleon's invasion of Russia, and the impact of
                the Napoleonic era on Tsarist society, as seen through the eyes
                of five Russian aristocratic families.

              <h1>Hamlet <span>by William Shakespeare</span></h1>
              <p>
                The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark, or more simply Hamlet,
                is a tragedy by William Shakespeare, believed to have been
                written between 1599 and 1601. The play, set in Denmark,
                recounts how Prince Hamlet exacts revenge on his uncle Claudius,
                who has murdered Hamlet's father, the King, and then taken the
                throne and married Gertrude, Hamlet's mother. The play vividly
                charts the course of real and feigned madness—from overwhelming
                grief to seething rage—and explores themes of treachery,
                revenge, incest, and moral corruption.

              <h1>The Odyssey <span>by Homer</span></h1>
              <p>
                The Odyssey is one of two major ancient Greek epic poems
                attributed to Homer. It is, in part, a sequel to the Iliad, the
                other work traditionally ascribed to Homer. The poem is
                fundamental to the modern Western canon. Indeed it is the
                second—the Iliad being the first—extant work of Western
                literature. It was probably composed near the end of the eighth
                century BC, somewhere in Ionia, the Greek-speaking coastal
                region of what is now Turkey. The poem mainly centers on the
                Greek hero Odysseus (or Ulysses, as he was known in Roman myths)
                and his long journey home following the fall of Troy. It takes
                Odysseus ten years to reach Ithaca after the ten-year Trojan
                War. In his absence, it is assumed he has died, and his wife
                Penelope and son Telemachus must deal with a group of unruly
                suitors, the Mnesteres or Proci, competing for Penelope's hand
                in marriage.

              <h1>Crime and Punishment <span>by Fyodor Dostoyevsky</span></h1>
              <p>
                It is a murder story, told from a murder;s point of view, that
                implicates even the most innocent reader in its enormities. It
                is a cat-and-mouse game between a tormented young killer and a
                cheerfully implacable detective. It is a preternaturally acute
                investigation of the forces that impel a man toward sin,
                suffering, and grace. Ever since its publication in 1866 Crime
                and Punishment has intrigued readers and sorely tested
                translators, the best of whom seemed to capture one facet of
                Dostoevsky's masterpiece while missing the rest.

              <h1>Pride and Prejudice <span>by Jane Austen</span></h1>
              <p>
                The book is narrated in free indirect speech following the main
                character Elizabeth Bennet as she deals with matters of
                upbringing, marriage, moral rightness and education in her
                aristocratic society. Though the book's setting is uniquely turn
                of the 19th century, it remains a fascination of modern
                readership, continuing to remain at the top of lists titled
                "most loved books of all time", and receiving considerable
                attention from literary critics. This modern interest has
                resulted in a number of dramatic adaptations and a plethora of
                books developing Austen's memorable characters further.
